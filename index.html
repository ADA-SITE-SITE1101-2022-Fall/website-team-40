            <h2>What is Hour of Code</h2>
            <p>Hour of Code is an annual event about coding.
            Its main purpose is to spread interest in computer science in diverse environments, especially among young girls and racial minorities.
            It uses not only online activities but also paper-based games making it available for computer free environments.
            Hour of Code is made for all ages starting from pre-readers to highschoolers and older.
            It has been conducted in more than 180 countries and 45 times in Azerbaijan in 2022.

                As we mentioned above, we conducted this event at School #274. 
                Although it is located quite far from the capital and the weather was poor, we did not hesitate to execute our mission. 
                In addition, students' enthusiasm encouraged us to do even better than what we had planned. 
                We would like to convey our gratitude to teacher Vusala Aliyeva and principal Nariman Mursaliyev for letting us carry out this event.

            <!--SAMPLE TEXT-->
            <p>
                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
                Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
                It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. 
                It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
